As stated, this is my current WIP that is my dad's website. It is for his music and is expanding on my knowledge of web based
development.

Fortunately, this was started after 1 and a half full successful projects done for work (contact me to see those if you wish to- they are incredible if I do say so myself). I am quite proud of what I have accomplished to date and this will continue
to expand into my own baby of a creation.
