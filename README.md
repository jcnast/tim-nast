As stated, this is my current WIP that is my dad's website. It is for his music and is expanding on my knowledge of web based
development.

Fortunately, this was started after 1 and a half full successful projects done for work (contact me to see those if you wish to- they are incredible if I do say so myself). I am quite proud of what I have accomplished to date and this will continue
to expand into my own baby of a creation.

The main components used in this website are API calls to Soundcloud for access to his music he has uploaded there, while
providing him a method through which he may host his own music if he chooses, and to make it available for download
or streaming.

*************************

To run this website, you will need django 1.7 (I do not believe any other libraries are required)

Once installed, open a terminal and go to this directory and type in:

'python manage.py runserver'

You will need to create an account uisng the sign-up page to view the full site, though you will not be able to see all of the features as some are meant only for my father.

*DO NOT USE PERSONAL INFO as it is not 100% secure yet.
